Usage
-----

```ruby
require 'tremendous'

# Configure with your sandbox / production token.
client = Tremendous::Rest.new(
  "[YOUR SANDBOX ACCESS TOKEN]",
  "https://testflight.tremendous.com/api/v2/"
)

#
# Generate an order.
#

# Campaigns are created within the dashboard by team admins.
# They define the catalog and presentation of your reward.
# API requests can always override these settings
# within the specific reward object by specifying the catalog, message, etc.
campaigns = client.campaigns.list
campaign_id = campaigns.first[:id]

# The funding source you select is how you are charged for the order.
# In this example, we use the prefunded balance funding source
funding_source_id = client.funding_sources.list.find { |f| f[:method] == "balance" }[:id]

# Optionally pass a unique external_id for each order create call
# to guarantee that your order is idempotent and not executed multiple times.
external_id = "[OPTIONAL_EXTERNAL_ID]"

# An array data representing the rewards you'd like to send.
order_data = {
  exteral_id: external_id,
  payment: {
    funding_source_id: funding_source_id,
  },
  reward: {
